PROMPT = """
You are given a JSON object containing a list of UI elements from a webpage. Each element contains a "category" (e.g., button, label, checkbox) and optional "text" (e.g., "Submit", "Username"). The "bbox" (bounding box) should be ignored, and no mention of coordinates should appear in your description.

For each element:
- Use the category and the text to generate a short, human-like description of the UI element.
- Describe the element as if you were explaining it to someone, but keep the description briefâ€”no more than a few words or a short sentence.
- Focus on what the element is and its purpose, based on its category and text, and ignore any bounding box or coordinates.
- Provide only a concise description as per the output schema and do not mention the bounding box in the description.
